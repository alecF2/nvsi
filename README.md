# NVSI Website - Event Page Branch
This is the branch for the "middle and bottom section" of the event page that includes:
1. Event Components that contain an image, event title, date, description (scrollable), related tags (scrollable), and a button for that event.
2. Navigational Tabs that switch the Event Components between Upcoming and Past events
3. Footer

All of which are reponsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.

## TODO List
- Lock the NavTabs in Desktop instead of moving based on viewports.
- Get mobile design specifics (spacing, typoraphy, etc) from design team.
- Add links from Event Details button to Event Details Page during merge.
- Add link from Subscribe button to Subscribe page
- Change colors of tags (backend help?)
- Make Event Details button placement more consistent based on .event size instead of .right size
